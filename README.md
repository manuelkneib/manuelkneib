### Hi there ðŸ‘‹,
I'm a strategy consultant and hobby Rails developer. In my final projects at Le Wagon in Lisbon me and my team built a marketplace for clowns (see repo 'Les_Bouffons') and a mobile first web-app to organize small league tournaments with friends (repo: 'Le_WaPong', url: lewapong.fun).

I have yet to see how much I'll be coding going forward and what I'll try to learn next...
